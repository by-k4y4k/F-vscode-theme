# F 0.3.2

## Deep Blue Sea

As in: I had forgotten that this hadn't been published when I wanted to use it on another computer.

This is a theme to make Markdown editing less samey (I do a lot of this in Code).

![F is for "far out this is great"](./img/example-md.png)

Also works for programming!

## Forget version 2, we're all grown up now!

(I say that like Internet Explorer 11 [once did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Jl6HlX3bM), in that this theme very much is still in early beta).

F 0.3.0 has a few quality-of-life tweaks, and a few changes to what is coloured what colour.

![yeah baby, check that screenshot](./img/example.png)

Fira Code looks nice, but F makes it nicer :wink:

## Why F?

F is the first letter in forgotten, _and_ it's my favourite letter, _and_ it's also something different. It's certainly easy to find in the Theme Picker :).

Interested? Hit ctrl/cmd-p inside of VSCode and type `ext install k4y4k.f`.

### What's that thing in the icon?

She's a wyvern who is, as yet, nameless.

## What now?

Also, if you do end up using this theme (and you like it), you can come tell me about it [on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/by_k4y4k) It'd be awesome to hear suggestions and/or feedback from someone else. Pull requests welcome on the [Git repo,](https://github.com/by-k4y4k/F-vscode-theme) too!
