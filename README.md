# F is for Forgotten

As in: I had forgotten that this hadn't been published when I wanted to use it on another computer.

F is a theme made for Markdown editing, by someone whose main use of VSCode is to write stories, novels and intentionally bad fanfiction. It's probably **not a great fit for code editing,** and got its start by editing the Monokai theme that comes with VSCode.
